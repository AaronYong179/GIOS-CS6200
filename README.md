### Lecture Notes

Lecture notes are created with Obsidian. Links to images may be broken unless viewed specifically with Obsidian. 

These notes were crafted while rewatching lectures, aided by the occasional reference to [omscs-notes](https://www.omscs-notes.com/operating-systems/welcome/). I rearranged certain sections in order to make the flow of logic more cohesive, as well as included quizzes and their answer (which omscs-notes does not provide at all).

_I do think that the lecture towards the end of the course becomes very content-heavy (and not in a meaningful way). Simply grinding the sample midterms/finals quizzes should be more than sufficient to net a good grade on the exams._
### Projects
#### Environment

I used WSL2 (running Ubuntu 20.04) for the projects, although I often worked on the projects on my other Ubuntu 22.04 setup. The 22.04 setup only failed when trying to work on Project 4.
